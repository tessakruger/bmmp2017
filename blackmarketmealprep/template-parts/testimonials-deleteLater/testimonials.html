						<p>Another place I have tried to replace My Fit Foods meals--I really like BMMP a lot &amp; will be ordering again for sure! Here are the many reasons: - Great customer service = The chef returned my call last week before I placed my order, and couldn't have been nicer--he answered all my questions &amp; gave me a coupon code since it was my first order. He also asked for suggestions (smart), so I also put them below my praise here.</p>

						<p>This is my first week ordering from BMMP and I am really impressed! I've tried one other meal prep company and I was so turned off because I received several meals where the brown rice was only half cooked (bleh!!). However, everything I've had so far from BMMP has been delicious and very well prepared...</p>
